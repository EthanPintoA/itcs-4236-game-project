Final project for "Artificial Intelligence for Computer Games" course.
You've heard of chess, you've heard of guns, but have you ever heard of chess WITH guns?!?!
Welcome to a 2d board game, you can play with a friend or against our AI. The goal is the same as chess where you must destroy your enemy's king. 

Important: Make sure that you set your display to 16:9, and ensure that the panels in Unity are adjusted so that the user interfaces in the game are properly aligned.
